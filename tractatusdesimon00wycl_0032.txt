XXVIII INTRODUCTION.

worldly power. He invents unchristian traditions for the sake of lucre3
he promotes curates for reasons quite irrelevant to his spiritual office,
which indeed debars him from any right to meddle with temporalitieS.
His claim to all patronage is an encroachment on the duties and rights
of the King, which the latter ought to resist. Non-resident Papal pre-
sentees‚ sor instance, should on no account draw any income. Cure of
souls is one thing, endowment is another; and to give any one a bene-
fice by which he gets an income is to usurp what rightly belongs to
the King. According to the Decretals, the founder of a benefice, not
the Pope, has the patronage of it; and, as a fact, all patronage was at
first in the hands of laymen. If it has passed into the Pope's hands, it
is by illegal acquisition. It is a pure fiction to claim that temporal
goods belonging to the clergy are something temporal but connected
with things spiritual, so that the Pope has right over them. Patronage
is really a spiritual right which justly belongs to laymen7 and cannot
pass from them without simony. [n the primitive Church, the clergy were
always appointed by popular election (pp. 27—37).

It is said that, under lay rule, the Church would be robbed. En-
dowments, at least so far as they imply superfluity, would indeed be
suppressed3 but this would not wrong the Church. It is a crime to take
anything away from the Church which belongs to it lawfully; but no
one doubts that an Antipope or a heretic may be deprived of what be
wrongfully possesses; and Wyclif's position is, that all possession in
the Church, beyond the bare necessities of existence, is wrongful, and
causes the possessor to be a simoniacal heretiC. Those who give such
excessive endowments‚ rob the Church of its virtue, and are its real
spoilers‚ no matter what their intention may be. St. Paul, before his
conversion, was a persecutor of the Church, though he acted in good
saith. The heresies now prevalent about the Eucharist and sacramental
confession run parallel with the doctrine of endowments and gifts made
to the Church. Innocent III’s decrees would find thousands of prelates
ready to maintain them, and to say that an endowed clergy is more
perfect than one disendowed, because of the necessities of our times.
But these thousands would not make them any the more true; they
would only taint themselves with the leprosy of simony (pp. 37—40).
