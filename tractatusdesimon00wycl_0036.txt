XXXII INTRODUCTION.

things his temporal possessions which are the patrimony of the poor,
and if he yield to greed in his way of receiving the honours due to
him, or in the manner of collecting his revenue. As to the latter point,
there are thousands of diabolical contrivances: heavy sees for the bene-
diction of churches and churchyards3 five marks, and upwards, it is said.
They allege that the spiritual grace is given freely‚ and that only the
Bishop's bodily trouble is paid for; but it is paid for excessively‚ and
reminds us of the miser who was told he could have dainties for nothing,
whilst common food was very dear; so he fed his servants with the
dainties‚ and ate common food himself: but his steward‚ 011 giving in
his account, set the price of the common food so high that it covered
the price of the dainties too. Besides, this bodily labour or trouble comes
under the definition of simony3 for is it not ‘temporale spirituali annexumP³
A Bishop's corporal labour is worth no more than that of a layman,
unless we consider it in connexion with his standing as a Bishop. If this
is a real payment‚ the Bishop has the right to exact more, according as
his position is higher and the demand —— the necessity of the ssock —-
greater. I suppose that Wyelif means that a Bishop's fee, like a phy-
sician's, might then be fixed according to his celebrity and the want of
his services This would open the question as to how far a physician's
see is the purchase os his knowledge rather than of his work. -- Either
the Bishop’s labour is worth as much as that of a layman, or infinitely
more; so he ought either to make a free gift of it, or exact a reason-
able price. As to the functions themselves, why should not a priest who
can consecrate Christ⁷s Body, consecrate a church too? There are, by
the way, too many of these ceremonies, and they are a burden to the
Churcl). We should not absolutely reject them, but they must not be
set above Scriptum, and should be caresully kept down to what they
used to be in early times. A Bishop may even accept money freely
given to him, at a ceremony which he performs gratuitously on his
own part. But all this — as Innocent writes in the Decretals, forbidding
any exactiori whatever —— is full of the danger of simony (pp. 70—78).
