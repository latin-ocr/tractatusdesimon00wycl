way, to note down what Ihave long believed to be true3 viZ.‚ that
Wyclis, for some reason or other, never made a deep study of the works
of St. Thomas. He very seldom alludes to him, at least by name, either
in his theological or in his philosophical treatises3 when he does, it is
always (as on the present occasion) with much respect, but with no
evidence that he was well acquainted with the doctrine and the argu-
ments of that famous Doctor. To any one who knows the unique position
held by St. Thomas amongst the Doctors of the Church, both in the
Middle Ages, and even down to the present day, this will seem more
than strange; it is unaccountable. Ι do not see how it was possible for
such a man either to know little of St. Thomas, or knowing· much, to
resrain from quoting him when in agreement, or from refuting his ar-
guments when in opposition to his own.

Simony, according to the eAngelic Doctor³, is the deliberate will
to sell or buy anything spiritual or connected with spiritual things. It
is called a heresy‚ because the act implies that such purchase or sale
is allowed. It is forbidden, for the reason that none may sell what they
do not really possess as their own: and God's grace is the property
of G0d; men are only its channels. Priests have not even the right (of
their own will) to exchange benefices with one another. As the Pope is
merely the distributor of Divine grace, not its owner, it follows that he
can incur sizsnony. In view of what comes in the following chapters‚ Ι
transcribe the whole of this important passage, which I cannot conceive
that Wyclif would have left unquoled, if he had known it. “Papa potest
incurrere vitium simoniae, sicut et quilibet alius homo: peccatum enim
tanto in aliqua persona est gravius, quanto majorem obtinet locum.
Quamvis enim res Ecclesiae sint ejus, ut principalis dispensatoris, non
tamen sunt ejus, ut domini et possessoris. Et ideo, si reciperet pro aliqua
re spirituali pecuniam de redditibus ecclesiae alicujus, non careret vitio
simoniae. Et similiter etiam posset simoniam committere recipiendo peccu-
niam ab aliquo laico, non de bonis Ecclesiae³³ (2*Ί 2³⁶, qu. C. art. 1.
Ad 7¹¹³). — It is not allowed to receive any money (or pa) ment of any
sort) for the administration of the Sacraments, i. e. for the spiritual
grace which they consen but only for the bodily sustentation of the
ministers of grace, and as a remuneration for their trouble. Rather than
give money for the grace conferred by Baptism, for instance, a man

ought to die without baptism, trusting to God's grace, and desiring to
