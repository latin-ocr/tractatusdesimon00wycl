of Reims, unless Wyclif mistook and means Louis VII. See note, p. 58).
It is pretended that the payment of firstfruits is a free gift, but this is
a mere pretence; there is a tacit, though not 311 explicit compact. Let
the presentee refuse to pay, and he will soon see if it is considered
as a free gift. As to the payment being made after, not before pro-
moti0n‚ that makes no difference. (See above, p. XX1V3 St. Thomas con-
siders the difference to be great.) Gehazi made no compact with Naaman
before he was cured of his leprosy; yet his act was simoniacal all the
same, and leprosy fell upon him; so has spiritual leprosy fallen upon
the Popes; for leprosy means simony in its mystic 561156. Leprosy deforms
the body, stinks in the nostrils, is most infecfious, and causes the leper
to be separated from other men: all these characteristics are fulfilled in
simony (pp. 54—-62>.

Simony as to patronage has long been rampant in England. It is
defended under the ,pretext of the Pope's authority; which amounts to
setting it up against that of Christ. Paul withstood Peter; and we have
the right to withstand the Pope in this. No man 6311 put him above
Gospel Law. In so far as he follows it, he should indeed be obeyed;
but no farther. Any permission given by him to transgress it, is a dead
letter, and is no more a permission than a dead man is a man. In such
cases, the Pope himself should make satisfaction, being, in the wrong;
and all Christendom‚ being obliged to follow him in this, ought, whether
he does or not, to reprobate and resist such practices. Failing to do
so, it is punished, together with the Pope. How glorious it would be
for the Church, if our Pope Urban VI would return to the ancient state,
as it was in the days of Urban I! It is a grievous heresy to affirm that
whatever the Pope allows is allowed; for Peter, whom Paul resisted
to his face, had no power to allow the commission even of one venial
sin: no more has any Pope in our times. His dispensations are valid
only in so far 35 God grants them with him; and the heresy which
affirms the contrary brings many others after it. — Here comes the
second and the longer of the two digressions relative to the Eucharist
(pp. 62—70).

Chapter VI. A Bishop may incur shnony, if he takes office rather
for the dignity and profit which will accrue to him, than with a view
to benefit both his own soul and the Church, Also during his episco-
pate, if he neglect 1115 (1111165, if he lavish on himself and on superfluous
