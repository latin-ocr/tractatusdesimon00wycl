lN‘l‘RfflffltJI‘ION XXXVII

a law 01 the Church that simoniacs have not the right to celebrate
Mass (cantare missam). It is therefore false to say that all Masses have
equal worth. A simoniacal Bishop blasphemes in every one of the func-
tions which he seems to perform. Blessiugs, consecrationS, ordinations,
confirmations, are all equally invalid from their hands. They are ana-
thema; how 0311 they sanctify others? A Bishop is consecrated with the
taint 01 simony: he gives gold and loses his soul. He consecrates others
simoniacally3 they give gold and receive leprosy. There is therefore no
essential order of hierarchical subjection between such a Bishop and his
clergy; but Christ ordains whom, how, and when He 01100505, to make
good what is wanting. We do not know with what rites He consecrated
His apostles. This teaches us to think little of externals. Wyclif concludes
by repeating once more his appeal to the secular power (pp. 109-113).

Such is, in substance, the tractate De Simonia. It is the work of
3 powerful and logical mind, travelling from certain fixed premises to
conclusions which necessarily flow from thern. If those premises are
admitted, the inferences must be granted. But, at the same time, there
is no doubt that many of Wyclif’s contemporaries, without following him
111 311 1115 theories, were willing to grant the existence of a multitude
01 abuses in the Church; and for them this book had the advantage of
drawing their attention to the evil. Stin, there is no evidence that any
lasting reforms sprang up within the Church of England on account of
Wyclif's tractate. The reason is not difficult to find out. Such as were
in favour of reforming abuses were no doubt amongst the best 01 the
clergy; those that were against all reform were the worst: and the
latter could always point to what both parties considered as great
exaggerations‚ to say the least, and thus to paralyze the efforts (11 any
were indeed made) of the party of reform. Few Catholic Bishops or
priests cared to be counted‚ even unjusdy, amongst Wyclif's adherents;
and the majority 01 moderately-thinking men were naturally unwilling to
look at any such movement otherwise than with distrust and suspicion.
As for the influenee of De Simouicz (taken of course along with that 01
Wyclif's other works dealing with the same subject) on public opinion
outsicle of the ranks of the clergy, it seems no exaggeration to say that
it prepared and facilitated the great cataclysm which, two centuries later,
swept away the monastic houses in England, and put such a great part
of the Church revenues into the hands of the ctemporal lords³.
