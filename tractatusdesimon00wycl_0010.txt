VI lNTRODUCTlON.

of abode, and the whole work, both of description and of critical ex-
mination, had to be done over again. This, however, is now accomplish-
ed; and Ι can bring my part in the edition to a close, entreating the
public to take into account the extenuating circumstances I have men-
tioned, which have caused so long a delay in the publication of this book.

I here very gladly avail myself of the occasion to follow a custonl
which is now becoming quite general, and to mention all those who
have lent me a helping hand. I wish especially to thank Dr. Furnivall‚
Mr. Matthew — who not only translated the side-notes, but aided me
in every way, both by his advice and his active help —— the Officers of
the Hofbibliothek, Dr. Goldlin von Tiefenau and Dr. Rudolf Beer; those
of the Prague University, and Prof. Ingram, the head librarian of Trinity
College, Dublin, who sent their MSS. to Vienna for me; Prof. Ingram in
particular showed me much kindness. My best thanks are due to all

these gentlemen.

Π. The Manuscripts and their transmiSsion.

The treatise De Sintonia has come down to usin nine manuscripts,
of which seven belong to the Imperial Library, Vienna, one to the
I'rague University Library, and one to Trinity College, Dublin. I have
thought it best to letter them, from a to i, in the following order.

1. Cod. Vindob. 4536 (a). Fully described by Dr. Buddensieg, in
his Introduction to Wyclif’s Polemical Works, pp. XLIV—XLVI. Also
(very briefly) in the Dialogus by Mr. Pollard, Introduction, p. XXIV.

De Simonia extends from f. 133 to f. 191‘. The Argumentum
comes before the treatise itself. The chapters are denoted by initials in
red ink, and by numbers in the margin, which also contains subdivisions
of the chapters (A, Β, and so on), catchwords‚ and numerous correc-
tions, with marks to refer them to their place in the text. Many of the
mistakes are corrected by means of erasures and marginal additions;
many are left uncorrected. The handwriting belongs to the first decade
of the 15⁰¹ century. After the closing lines Explicit—prelatos, there is
an index of catchwords: Sequitur Regislrum.
