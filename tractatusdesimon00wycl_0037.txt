come to him for ordination seldom or never offer presents of their own
accord; yet free gifts are all that the Decretals allow to be made. If
these be called free, then we have an ample excuse for the buying
and selling of benefices; that would imply only the purchase of the tem-
poral profit attached to them, and the use of the temporalities. But by
the law of the Church, all such traffic is forbidden. — The Bishop's
officers, too, are said to buy their offices3 confessions and baptisms are
paid for by a elever evasion of the law3 and the Bishop, living in state,
having grooms who tend unnecessary horses⁷ and servants kept with the
property of the poor, thus makes money for himself with simoniacal
greed. As a result, he cares very little for the spiritual side of the
matter. The world, and not God, is the god of such a Bishop! It would
be far better for him to have nothing but the bare neeessaries of life;
and our rulers, by taking the means of luxury from him, would be doing
3 good deed. Poverty is inculcated by Canon law: it only allows pre-
sents freely given, not exacted‚ We should indeed help those nearest to
us (and the Bishop, as our pastor, is of such) but only to relieve them
when they require it. And the episcopal dignity does not stand in need
of outward pomp, any more than that of Christ and His Apostles

Chapter VII, is aimed at the endowed Orders. Simony reigns
amongst them at their entrance into the Order, during their stay, and
at their egress (v. g. to become curates of parishes given to Abbeys
by appropriation). A richer man is accepted more readily than a poorer
one, though the latter may be the better of the two. Here Wyelif assails
the system of corrodies, which (as appears by a notice from Mr.
Matthew, quoted in the Addenda) was a system of life-annuities, either
in money or in kind, given in return for a certain sum or possession
made over to the Order Wyclif observes that it implies a doubt of
Christ's words on the part of him who wants to give up his property,
but is afraid of having no assured means of subsistence. Then, instead
of the poor getting the surplus of the Abbey's (or monastery's) income,
it has to be given to the rich. This may (and does) go so far, that the
whole income is often barely sufficient to pay the corrodieS, and the
monastery itself is ruined. If such bargains be allowed, convents might
make any other bargains they chose, either with Bishops or other pre-
lates. As St. Boniface says, no spiritual gift should be bought for
