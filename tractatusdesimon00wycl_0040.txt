XXXVI INTRODUCTION.

the Pope may abrogate any law, how are we to know where he will
stop? These collectors ought not to be tolerated (pp. 98—104).

What should be done to simoniacs? In the Old Law, they were
put to death3 in the New, 1116)- are to be shunned 13) all Christians. As
a fact, they are excommunicate& if known as such. This vice is, howe-
ver, so prevalent that we cannot entirely cut ourselves off from the
society 01 simoniacs; but it is enough to separate ourselves from all
fellowship with simony itself (pp. 104—105). Here Wyclif is more leni-
ent, as it would seem at first sight, than the Church of Rome, and even
than the text of St. John which he quotes: “Nec ave ei dixeritis?> If a
man is excommunicated, he should be avoided, lest we share in his
wickedness. But the width 01 Wyclif's definition prevents his practically
following up his conclusion to the extent intended by Church law. On
the other hand, he was able to point to the general view of the best
theologians, that in a case of simony‚ every man must follow his own
conscience and certain knowledge, and does not require to await a legal
decision. See above, in the exposition of St. Thomas' doctrine.

We must obey God rather than man. Monks ought to refuse their
aid in getting appropriations, even though commanded by their Supe-
riors‚ and even when it is allowed by the Pope. It is a false excuse
101 1611115511655 111 inveighing against this evil, to say that a Friar in his
convent has not to meddle with such questions. When he knows that
they are in the wrong, he should reprove them. Some leave the appro-
priated churches to vicars, in order not to be burdened with secular
duties; but a benefice entails duties which may not be set aside. At
the Day of Judgment, they will be responsible in their own persons for
souls lost3 besides, this would at best be buying the vicar's services;
and no one has a right to do anything by which the Church may
suffer detriment. The office 01 preaching‚ too, which never was so
necessary as now, would suffer thereby. This duty falls upon all; and
the higher the rank, the more strict the duty, both for the Pope and
for Bishops, Wyclif admits that the superfluity of a parish may be given
away, but only by the free will of the givers (pp. 105—109).

One extreme conclusion 01 11115 doctrine is said, to be that it would
render all Church rites invalid, since all are performed by simoniaCS.
But the fact is that, as they are ipso flcclo suspended from their office,

it would be a gain for the Church if they ccased to minister, and it is
