INTRODUCTION. XXIX

benefices; the Apostles did not apply to St. Peter to choose Maffiias, but
drew lots, as should be done when it is not evident who ought to be
chosen. The ssock knows best who can serve its wants. The people7
according to St. Jerome, ought to be present at the election‚ and attest
who is and who is not worthy. In old times, either God appointed by
direct interposition, or the people elected the candidate; but now we
appeal to the Pope. The people is so blind that whilst it would defend
its own temporal rights, even to death, it calmly stands by, while the Pope
takes away its right to things spiritual. What lte wants‚ is not their good,
but the increase of his own tempora] sway and worldly power (pp. 40—44).

Therefore, Kings, wake up! shake off the chains of heresy. Allow
not your liegemen to go the fountain head of simony, that great school
of the devil, which exhausts the kingdom both of men and money. Were
there an invasion of foemen or an outbreak of leprosy in the realm,
your duty would be clear: but we have here to do with far worse.
Provide good theologians throughout the kingdom; be careful to appoint
no clerks for secular services rendered to you. The revenues of the
elergy, taken by the King, would be sufficient to remunerate them
without any such appointments. Those are traitors who say that this
taking of the Church possessions would be a greater evil than such
simony; and as for excommunications, they need not be feared. Curses
turn to blessings‚ if given in such a cause (pp. 44—45).

In every election, the fittest should be chosen; not only any good
man (as some say), for whoever is not bad is good; but the best.
And any electiori in which the best man is not chosen is unjust, dis-
allowed by God, and null and void. To reject the fittest man is to
oppose God’s will; and if we fall away from His standard, we go lower
and lower indefinitely. Even a man chosen by God (as in the case of
Saul) may be bad; what right have we then to say: This man is good
enough, and ot set aside a better one? It is sheer presumption. Therefore
an election by majority has no weight at all; neither have bulls of pro-
vision, given to any one. It is a great sin even to do right against one's
conscience3 much more so to do wrong. And to give spiritual power
for gain is a worse sin than that of Simon Magus, since what he only
wanted to do is actually done. Whether the Pope or any one else
chooses a Bishop otherwise than by the rule here laid down, it is ‘a

grievous sin (pp. 45—49).
