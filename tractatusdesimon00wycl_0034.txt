'l‘o the question whether elections ought in general to be con-

demned, Wyehf, after several distinctions bearing on the word, answers
that no elections that follow mere human traditions, or that go begond
Scripture, are lawful. But 116 abstains from condemning such as are
implicitly contained in the principles of Holy Writ, and acknowledges
their utility. Should it be asked why, if many are fit, we are obliged to
choose the intest, the answer is: Because we ought to choose him whom
God has chosen3 and superiority of fitness <equality being impossible)
is the sign by which the Divine choice is known; of fitness, be it
understood, under che circumstances as they are. The Papal election‚
which some compare to God’s appointment of Moses, is by no means
a similar case. Moses was a type of Christ, and the Pope is only Christ's
Vicar in so far as he follows Him. And if he be, let him imitate Moses'
conduct in choosing the 70 elders; let him be like Moses, and we shall
obey him (pn 49-54)·

Chapter V. If the Pope has the right to reserve the firstfruits sor
one year, he can do so for two years; and so on, till he takes all for
himself. He may increase the number of his cardinals at will, and give
them any number of benefices, obtained in like manner. But, if service
should be inseparable from payment, when a benefice is vacant, the
laity ought to pay nothing. And if the Pope can separate these two,
then it is clear that we can have spiritual service without payment, as
it was in the times of the early Church, which were far better. This
is a great and heavy burden laid on the shoulders of seculars, and they
ought to resist. Pope Gregory X, who, at the Council of Lyons, gave
the prescriptions concerning tithes‚ also condemned the holding of many*
benefices; if the latter prescription is now a dead letter, why should the
former be obeyed? As the giving of firstfruits is simony on the part
of the giver‚ so is their acceptance on the part of the Pope: he takes
them principally from the priests whom he promotes, and because he
promoted them. Kings take a fifteenth, he takes the whole. He translates
bishops 3150, on purpose to get firstfruits from a greater number of
them. If we say that the Pope's universal power gives him the right to
act thus, we strike at the root of all temporal government. These
practices first obtained under John XXII, probably never before. St.
Louis burned the Papal bulls relative to the promotion of a certain
priest (probably him that Clement IV promoted to the archdeaconry
