XXVI INTRODUCTION.

receive that sacrament. Money may be given sor Masses, but merely
that the priest may have food to eat. Fines imposed as penance at ab·
solution from excommunication should be regarded as mere punishments,
and in no wise as the price of absolution. Custom is here of no value
against Divine law; if money is given for the consecration of a bishop‚
for an abbot’s instalment‚ &c., it is simony. If only at such ceremonies‚
as a customary see, it is not indeed simony3 but great care sould be
taken to avoid the very appearance of simony or of greed in such
cases, A candidate sor a bishopric has not the right to appease an
unjust opponent either by money or by a promise of money; when he
has become a Bishop, however, he may without sin take steps to get
rid of persecution. Money may be given for the sustenance of the clergy‚
but there must be no intention either to buy or to sell spiritual services;
and if money be withheld‚ the priest must take care to render his ser-
vices as before. No one is allowed to receive anything (except as a
free gift) on the occasion of admission into a monastery. It is forbidden
to sell the consecrated vessels, so long as they retain their form; in
cases of necessity, they must first be broken. A Bishop may, without
simony and for pious uses, take certain first-fruits from a benefice before
it is conferred; but to order the beneficiary to give the first-fruits would
be simony. Simoniacs should be deprived of their livings; priests whose
ordination is infected with simony receive the sacerdotal powers, but
not the right nor the grace to exercise them. It is not allowed to
receive Holy Orders from a bishop promoted by simony, even if this
is only known certainly, without any legal proof. A simoniacal priest
must not only give back his living, but all he has got or might have
got by it; unless he was unaware of the fact (if. τ’. g. a third person
committed simony for him without his knowledge). Monks received into
a convent by simony must leave it; the Pope alone can, in some cases,
dispense with these penalties; in others, the bishop has the power
to do so.

This short summary os the more important points in the question
De simonia may be sufficient to show that the Church, in principle at
least, and concerning simony in the contracted meaning given to it, is
hardly less severe than Wyclif. But Wyclis, as already remarked, takes
the widest possible view of things. According to him, as we may see
by a comparison with the first pages of De Aposlasia and De Blasphemia,
