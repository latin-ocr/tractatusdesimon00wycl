Church of Rome and in the Greek Church, not to speak of other com-
munities separated from them by still wider differences, that it is impos-
sible to explain the words by a metaphor, and that Christ’s Body and
Blood are really present in the Eucharist. Such being the fact, Ι think
it may be interesting to enquire 1) Whether the doctrine of 'l‘ransub-
stantiation was anything more than a denial of any explanation tending
to deny the reality of Christ's presence in the Sacrament; 2) Whether
Wyclif went farther than denying the doctrine of ‘accidens sine subjecto’‚
upheld by the Schoolmen of his day; and 3) How far his explanation
of Christ's real presence was unjusdy, and how far justly‚ condemned
by the Church from its own point of vien).

1. What is Reality, in the ordinary sense of the term? What is
the difference between a real orange and a painted one, 01· a wax
orange, or the result of mere hallucination? Evidently a painted orange,
however well painted, only deceives the sight, answering only to one of
the tests of reality. An artificial orange may deceive the touch too, and
if suitably perfumed, the sense of smell; but the sense of taste will soon
convince us that the object we see, touch and smell is not real — as
an orange. But suppose we are so hallucinated in all our senses, as to
see, feel, smell and taste an imaginary orange3 either we should find

that the hallucination did not last long, or if it did, we should no longer
be in a state to reason about it. It is, therefore, the answer to all the

sensible tests of reality, given in a permanent and coherent manner, that
constitutes sensible reality as we conceive it: it is upon the objective
value of these tests‚ taken together, that all natural science is founded.

And in this sense no Roman Catholic can deny —— or at least, the doc-
trine of Transubstantiation does not deny — that the Eucharistic bread

really remains aster consecration, and that Christ’s Body is not really
present. Every possible test of the sensible reality of bread is answered
without the slightest ambiguity. St. Thomas, I need not say, admits this
in his ‘Summa Theologica’; he asserts that the elements nourish, and
that the sacramental wine, if taken in excess, would intoxicate: which is
merely a doctrine of common sense. Nollzing of the reality, so sar as
the senses go, is changed by the sacramental words.

But then, how can this bread he Christ's Body really, if it is really
only bread? Hearing in mind the hypothesis which excludes a mere empty

metaphor‚ there is but one answer. We must believe in another sort of
