XX INTRODUCTION.

There were thus two parts in Wyclif's (loctrine; one seemingly
quite clear, the other all but unintelligible: and the results may be
guessed. Ι happen to have by me a curious instance, which may throw
some light upon the subject. “Lawrence de Saintmartin‚³² says Berault-
Belcastel (Histoire de l’Eglise, livre XLVI, p. 121) “having received corn-
munion at Eastertide, took the Host out of his mouth; and notwithstanding
the remonstrances of the priest, who followed him for some distance,
he carried it home in his hand. He then mixed it with other food, and
ate it, saying that it was no more worthy of respect than any other
bread.²³ This was in 1387.

Such a profanation would certainly have horrified Wyclif, who in
many and many a passage declares his belief — not seigned‚ not forced
from him by the sear of condemnation, but proceeding from hearty
philosophical conviction — that the Host‚ though naturally bread, is
really Christ’s Bocly. Ι quote only one, from De Apostasia, p. 243; but itis
amply sufficient. “Nos autem usque ad mortem . . . volumus . . . ex fide
defendere . . . quod panis et vinum . . . sit naturaliter ante consecracionem
panis et vinum, sed post consecracionem corpus dignissimum, quia vere
et realiter corpus Christi.” At the same time, it is quite conceivable that
Lawrence de Saintmartin would have been much astonished at Wyclif's
horror.

As a rule, when the Church of Rome condemns any proposition,
it condemns it in the ordinary and usual sense of the words, caring little
enough whether the author meant something orthodox in his own mind,
but very much whether the effect produced amongst those whom his
doctrines reach is in favour of orthodoxy. Now orthodoxy, according to
the Church of Rome, is the truth, to which even the poorest have a
right. And therefore, answering the question propounded as to the justice
or injustice of Wyclif's condemnation, we may say that (of course from
the above standpoint) it may perhaps, from a theological point of view,
have been unjust towards him, but that it was an act of justice towards
others who were sure to misunderstand him. It is even possible that his
judges mistook his meaning; which, if true, would have been an additional
proof that it was easily misunderstood.

Rome is in practice very far from condemning all propositions
which may be erroneous or true in themselves, and of which the

obvious :md popular meaning is simply erroneous. Should any one,
