VIII INTRODUCTION.

The margins are wide, with a few words in smaller letters written upon
them here and there. Only one column to each page.

De Simonia extends from f. 83 to f. 128, with blank spaces wher-
ever the copyist could not make out a word. The Chapters have no
subdivisions. The Argumeafztmn is placed at the beginning; the verses
‘Explicit . . . prelatis’, form the conclusion. The eConclusio2 (ff. 127¹ - 128)
does not belong to De simonia.

3. Cod. Vindob. 4504 (c). Described by me for Mr. Harris: See
De Benedicta Incarnatione7 Introduction, p. XII. I subjoin a fuller de-
scription of what especially concerns De Simonia. This tractate extends
from f. Ι to f. 36. No title. A few corrections, both on the margin and
in the text. The remark that De Compositione Hominis is non examinatus
can by no means be taken as a proof that the other MSS. are examinati.
De Simonia is also uot properly corrected. Gaps have been left unfilled
in the places of illegible wordS‚ and many absurd blunders have been
allowed to remain. Writing of the first decade of the XV1¹¹ century. Spaces
are left for initial letters to be filled in. The Argumentum is at the
beginning of the book. No subdivisions of chapters. Instead of the lines:
“Explicit—prelatos”‚ there is “Explicit tractatus de Symonia³³.

4. Cod. Vindob. 4515 (ci). Shortly described in the Dialogus, Intro-
duction, p. XXIII; very fully in Buddensieg's Polemical Works of Wyclis
pp. XLVI—XLVIII.

De Simonia (ff. 27—67¹). No title. Several hands, all belonging to
the first decades of the XVth century. Many glaring blunders in the MS.
as first copied, are corrected by numerous marginal or supralinear notes;
here and there the original mistake has been erased, and the correct
text supplied. This of course considerably alters its value; a point
to which we shall subsequently allude. There are a few catchwordS.
The chapters have no subdivisions, but are indicated by red initials
The Argumentum stands first, and the lines “Explicit”‚ &o are
wantmg.

5. Cod. Vindob. 3927 (e)
Described by Buddensieg, Pol. Works of W. Ι. Vol. XLIII.

De Simonia- (ff. 53—74‘) has, besides the pagination that obtains
all through the work, a special pagination os its own. Each of the two
pages which face each other in the open book bear the same number,

and the four columns making up the two pages are lettered α, b, c and d
