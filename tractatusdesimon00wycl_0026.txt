is simony. Secular lords ought to put this down, according to Chrysostom
and Pope Pelagius. We should not wait for a Papal edict to fulfil our
duty; the Pope may himself be a simoniae. All illicit means of obtaining
benefices — whether petitions, services rendered, letters of recommen-
dation from temporal lords‚ or the employment of a third person to
plead in their favour —— render those who get the benefices, simoniacs
and heretics. Yet these men, thus tainted with heresy, dare to persecute
the faithful! (pp. 1—6.)

Resides these persons, there are others who sall into the same
heresy‚ though indirectly: Friars, by holding their peace and not pro-
testing against it3 and Rulers who take it under their protection. It is
our duty to speak out; our silence will not excuse us, any more than
ignorance will excuse the secular lords. We should speak‚ they should
act. If not, both we and they are damned for tacitly consenting to sin.
Let us do our duty, as we value eternal bliss. If we desire the realm
to be at peace, let us purify it from those bad priests who destroy all
good therein. There is also the temporal advantage to be considered.
Princes have the right to confiscate all the unjustly acquired possessions
of these heretics‚ and to cause things to return to their first state, as
they were in the primitive Church of Christ. If the right acquired by
conquest is valid, how much more so would such confiscation be! (pp. ὁ -— 8.)

But is impossible to extinguish simony‚ so long as its baneful
root —- i. e. endowment — is allowed to exist. The Church was
mighty‚ whilst unendowed; with endowment‚ all things changed;
the clergy, from Christian, became ‘Cesarean’ and worldly, and new
laws were made to extort money from the faithful. This simony is rightly
called spiritual sodomy, and because spiritual, is a yet more heinous
crime. Its source is Avignon. Some think that if the secular arm destroys
that nest of wickedness‚ the Church will return to its pristine purity; but
Wyelif sears that the evil, like Gehazi’s leprosy, will cling to it for ever3
one source being stopped up, another will spring forth (pp. 8—9).

So long as they last, we may safely predict that wars and fightings
amongst nations will never cease. War reigns every where, not only in
the secular spheoe, but also· amongst friars and monks, and in the Uni—
versities; poor scholars are forced to pay large sums, and there is
acception of persons in private colleges. All these things cause discord
