INTRODUCTION. XXIII

to introduce or defend simonyl “Peace on earth, good-will to rnen’'
implies that men should have good-will to Christ; and Christ hates simony,
as is proved by His conduct in the temple. Resides, simoniacs‚ worse
than Iscariot, sell Him again and again, not for the salvation of the
world, but for the damnation of their own souls; and they devour Christ
most foussy by this their crime (pp. 9—12).

No sin is more directly opposed to God's law: “Freely ye have
received, freely give,’³ says Christ. Christ is the mystic Door, which is
closed against shnony, and which it strives to break down; thieves and
robbers enter by stealth, Christ tolerating sor the present that which He
will most severely punish one day, and most justly too: for simoniacs
sacrifice the true God to their idol, money, and commit sacrilege in His
very presence, which the devils themselves would sear to do. All this
springs from the blindness of our rulers, who tolerate such things.
(pp· 12—14)·

In Chapter II, Wyclif refutes objections against his definition and
theory of simony: Irst Obseclion. It differs from that given in the Decre-
tals‚ and approved by St. Thomas. 2¹¹d. It denies even to *one who is
fit, the right to ask for promotion, and creates difficulties as to how far
a man is bound to give up a benefice wrongly obtained, and whether
we may or may not go to Rome for benefices. 3¹³¹. It is an act, not
a volition3 a heresy, which a mere act of the will cannot be; and be-
sides, being an act, it is positive, whilst sin is a mere privation. Wyclif
defends his position in scholastic form, first pointing out verbal defects
in the Decretal's “studiosa voluntas emendi vel vendendi aliquid spirituale
vel spirituali annexum³’. His own definition is preserved from being too
wide, by the word ‘inor(linata’. In a sense, every dealer who buys or
sells anything fraudulently may be called a simoniae. The Apostles
received temporal aid, but only according to their needs. By this rule,
if a priest takes more than he really wants, or accepts a living for
which he is not fit, he commits simony. Such men are not even priests.
A man in mortal sin sins mortally in whatever he does; and a simoniacal
priest brings a curse both on himself and on all those who communicate
with him. How then can he sanctify others? Accurst himself, how can he
bless? God curses his blessings. — If we know a man to be fit for a
benefice, we may labour to have him promoted, for then our desire is
not inordinate; but it is unlawful to thrust oneself into office. If we have
