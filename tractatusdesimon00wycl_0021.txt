INTRODUCTION. XVII

reality, revealed to us by Christ's words; a reality that has nothing to
do with the senses; a reality that can coexist together with and inde-
pendently of, those phenomena which we perceive; a reality no less true
than they are true, no less real than they are real. 11 we can say 31161
60115661311011, ‘This is bread’, we only mean what we outwardly perceive.
If we can say, <This is Christ’s Body', we mean what we do not perceive,
and what we know by saith alone; but we know that 0116 15 35 truly
present as the other. Therein lies the mystery. Transubstantiation, as
defined by the Council 01 Trent‚ does not (unless I greatly mistake)
pretend either to solve or to explain it. It is a mere assertion that in
the Host there is nothing present but Christ's real Body, and real phe-
nomena which are not Christ⁷s Body. It does not assert that anything
01 1116 bread 15 annihilated; and this is very important. St. Thomas ex-
pressly says the contrary; he says that the bread becomes (transit in)
Christ’s Bocly3 not by transformation, for then there would be 311 exter-
1131 and sensible change, which there is not. And yet there is an <other-
ness³, as modern philosophers would say. This ‘otherness³, which super-
venes without in the least affecting any 01 1116 properties of the thing
that was, is the Real Presence; and what takes place 15 called, for want
of 3 better term, Transubstantiation. Such 15 1116 doctrine 01 1116 Church
of Rome, which leaves the mystery just 35 11 was before. It condemns
those who say that Christ is present, not really, but in figure, because
that would be against Scripture. It condemns (or 31 least, Ι think,
disapproves) those who assume that the bread is annihilated, and that
God creates a fantastic appearanoe, a permanent hallucination3 for this
would attack the evidence of our senses. It condemns those who say that
the bread, remaining mere bread, becomes Christ's Body (consubstan-
tiation), 101 11115 would be tantamount to saying that a man, remaining
a pauper, becomes a millionnaire. In short, it condemns all those who
either assail the sensible reality causing our percepts‚ and the non-sen-
sible reality 01 what faith affirms to be present. And I wish especially
to call attention to the fact that the Council 01 Τ16111, in its declaration
on the subject, nowhere decides that the accidents remain without a
subject; it merely asserts that all the appearances and properties —
which coincide with what I have called sensible reality — remain un-
changed: and yet, in a certain mysterious sense, it is no longer bread,

since it has become the 13011)- 01 our Lord.
