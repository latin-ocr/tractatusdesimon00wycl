INTRODUCTlON. Xl

The investigation of the comparative value of these nine MSS. is
attended with no slight difficulty. Some of them -- I allude especially
to f and g —- must have copied into the text the marginal notes and
various readings which existed as such in their originals; a circumstance
which detracts from the purity of their genetic connection, and renders
it hard to come to a decision as to their origin. Others, especially a and d,
are full of corrections which totally change their value, and so much alter their
value that we must ascribe one source to the corrected, and another to
the unaltered texts, We should also remember that the originals (which
we no longer possess) were written in the highly abbreviated style of
the XIVth and XVth centuries, in which a single characteristic letter, or
other sign, is often made to do duty for a whole word. Evidently, a
scribe ignorant of the sense of what he was copying would be very likely
rather to guess at the word than to read it; this was very often the
case. On this account, we find MSS. that are very nearly related —
such, for instance, as c and e, α and g, differing a good deal at times
in their respective readings, whilst agreeing with others which are much
more remotely related. Nevertheless, and taking all this into considera-
tion, Ι think I may point to certain fixed and definite conclusions.

It seems in the first place evident that the common source (X)
from which all our MSS. have been copied, is not the first copy of all,
but a text which is in certain places so corrupt as to be quite unintel-
ligible (see notes to pp. 27, l. 1—5, and 60, l. 18), whose mistakes
have been repeated in all the nine MSS. and can be corrected only by
conjecture.

The MSS. may be divided into two classes, from the standpoint
of their agreement with each other and with their common source: the
Dublin MS. (h) is on one side, and the rest are on the other. This classi-
fication is based on the critical foot-notes that show how often h gives
readings that differ from all the others; readings that produce not an
arbitrary and accidental difference, but a considerable modification of the
text. Thus, a b c d e fg z· must have been copied from a single manu-
script which we may call Y, and which stands to the original X in
the same relation as h. Again, in the Y group‚ i stands apart, having
several distinctive peculiarities — one of which is, for instance, that the
Argumentum is placed at the end — and agreeing with Ιι much oftener
than any other of its group; so that it may be considered as a con-
