INTRODUCTION. IX

respectively.¹ Two hands have worked at this as on the foregoing trac-
tate3 no doubt the same ones. The first is from f. 53 to f. 6o‘; the
second, from 61 to 75¹: both belong to the first decades of the XV1¹¹
century. With the exception of the first letter in the tractate, no initials
are filled up. There are many marginal corrections, also catchwords;
some of the gaps are not filled in, others have been filled in at a later
date with a different ink. A note, “Gertrudis virginis& at the end of
Ch. ΙΙΙ, shows probably that the copyist had reached this point of his work
on the Ι7ῑ11 March, St. Gertz-ude's day. The Argzmzenlum is at the beginn-
ing of the b00k3 the final verse, “Explicit‚³³ &o is wanting. After
“semper regnat³³, come the words (ΕΒ. de Symonia’³, ancl an index of
catehwords which differs from that in α ancl g. A few specimens will
suffice.

Utrum liceat curiam Romanam adire pro beneficiis, c. 5. C.

Quare clericis legis civiles et phisice sunt prohibite, d. 9.

De corpore Christi, c. 13 . . .

And so on. The numbers refer to the separate pagination; the
letters, to the columns.

6. Cod. Vindob. 3937 (f). Size, 29 cm by 21. Paper. 186 leaves,
many of them blank, but numbered from first to last by a modern hand.
On the cover and fly-leaf the words “Dono habui³² are written in a
hand of the XVI¹¹¹ century. Inside the cover is an index of contents, in
XVth century handwriting. The MS. is a collection of tracts by Hus,
Richard Fitzralph and others, noticed at some length in the Tabulae
Manuscriptorum: nothing of Wyclif is here, except De Simonia, from
f. 115 to f. 137⁴. The writing belongs to the first years> of the XV¹¹1 cen-
tury; each page is in two columns, with here and there a catchword and
explanatory notes on the margin3 the word Nota occurs frequently. There is
no lettered subdivision of the chapters, but the paragraphs are denoted by
the sign q in red ink. The copy is very incorrect, and full of mistakes‚
which quite destroy the sense, and show that the scribe did not under-
stand what he was writing. After the final verses “Explicit” &o there
follows: “Amen dicant³'; and then, in a different ink: “Finitus est iste

tractatus anno 1401.’³
1 This confirms what is known from other MSS. that the original ‘folio’ was

the open double page folded in the middle. The word was afterwards used for
a leaf. (Note by Dr. F. J. Furnivall.)
