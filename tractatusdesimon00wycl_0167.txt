P. 22, l. 14. The work to which W elif
alludes is obviously De Officio Pastoram w ich
was published by Lechler, 1863. There are se-
veral passages which may serve to elucidate
others in De Simonz'a: especially Pars 2⁰,
c. XI, p. 45 in which Wyclif accuses himself
of not being faultless as concerns temporal
possessions, and points out the means of aton—
mg for such shortcomings. Compare De Si-
monia, p. 21: “Omnes enirn sumus in inpetra-
cione, in accepcione, et in execucione bene-
ficii ecclesiast1ci maculati . . . .’' But Wyclif,
in the present passage, seems to allude to his
commentary on the eleclion of St. Mathias,
Pars 2⁸, e. IX, pp. 42, 43. I also find a short
commentary on St. Paul's sketch of the virtue
a Bishop ought to have, Pars 1¹², c. IV, p. 11

dently alludes to Ch. IV. of De Potes-tate Pape,

P. 59, l. 7. In De Poteslate Pape, c. X, we
find a lengthy account how the Pope, in ans-
wer to complaints that nothing could be had

 

in Rome without mone ‚ pointed out that the
cause was poverty‚ an asked for a fixed sub-
sidy u on ecclesiastica] revennes to be granted
him. (ΖΡ. X. ff. 216 b 2 gtowards the latter half),
217 a¹. Wyclif calls this a ‘scandaloza peticio‘7
and proceeds to justify his epithet at consi-
derable length. His authority for the fact is th'e
‘cronica que intitulatur flores historiarum&

P. 68, l. 36. De Veritate Sacre Scripture.
This work ot Wyclif has not yet been publish-
ed, and the1Wyclif Society considers it un-
necessary to wait until its publication.

P. 84, l. 21. A corrody, according to an
interesting and valuable communication by Mr.
MattheW‚ “was a life annuity, granted by a con-
vent a ainst an immediate pa ment. Thus,
about 1527, Lord William ‘of Li lebourn made
over to the Convent of Winchester a constde—
rable property about 10 miles from the city, in
return for which the Convent paid him yearly
ἓ 10 in money; robes, ἃς. to value of fi 2. 3 . o
and certain payment in kind (hay⁷ oats, dte.)
worth about 40 shillings. ln 1334, there is a
note in the Convent accounts of the last pa '-
1116111, and ‘nothing more, because he is dead'.

ln 1330, one Richard Becke pays ξ 50, in
return t'or a corrody of one conventual loaf and
one pot of conventual beer daily.

These corrodies may have had their rise
in providing for the case of a person who
wished to give his property to the convent,
but could not leave himself without support.
In later times, it became a regular (but not
always thrifty) way of raising ready money.
When the monasteries were suppressed, one
of the enquiries that the commissmuers had to
make was what corrodies each had to pay.'⁷
