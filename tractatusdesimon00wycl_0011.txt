And so on. The numbers indicate the chapters; the letters, their
subdivisions.

2. Cod. Vindob. 1622 (b). Size 22¹s2 by 14¹]2 cm. 188 numbered
leaves, of which several are left blank between the different tractates;
at the end there are 16 blank leaveS. Bound in leather-covered boards.
On the inside of the first cover there is a summary of contents iu two
different hands, both of the XVth century, as follows:

a) Tractatus magistri Stanislai doctoris theologie de peccato et gracia.
—- Tractatus de symonia. -— b) De innocentia W. sine fine. Conclusio
quod Christi perfectissima est religio. Dyalogus W. — Tractatus 44
conclusionum contra monachos W. - Responsio 5 conclusionum W.

Tractatus de ordinibus clericorum. -— Item verbum communiter
dictum clero. Item de quatuor sectiS.

On the inside of the other cover, there is: . . . (an illegible word)
de peccato et gracia magistri Stanislai‚ de symonia, dyalogus Wykleff
(Handwriting of the ΧΧῘΙῙ11 century). The contents are inexactly given in
the Tabulae Manuscriptorum of the Hofbibliothek: ff. 65—82¹ are not
quite blank. Ff. 73-—75 contain a fragment of Wyclif's De Statu Inno-
centiae (Incipit.· Ut supra dicta magis . . . Explicit: suppleat sic eadem
natura) already noticed by Shirley in p. 7 of his catalogue (No 340 of
Denis). Then follows, after De Simonia, the ‘Conclusio' of which the
table on the first cover makes mention (Incip..· Conclusio pura religio
Christiana . . . Expl..· subditum perfectos religiosos etc. ff. 127¹—128).
The three last tracts in this volume are: De Ordine (ff. 180—181‘),
De Demonio lileridiano (ff. 181‘-183‘) aud De Sectis Monachorum
(ff. 183⁴—188) noticed in the Tabulae under other names, and over-
looked by Shirley. The writing‚ which is very good and careful, and
which seems — in spite of noticeable differences in certain passages -
to be the work of a single copyist, belongs to the first half of the XV¹¹¹
century. No earlier date can be assigned to it, for we find the following
words on f. 64¹: “Explicit hic tractatus de peccato et gracia magistri
Stanislai labore editus sacre theologie professoris a. d. 1410. et cetera.³³
It is a beautiful MS. with coloured initials and vignettes at the beginning

of the more important tractates; the parchment is very fine and white.
