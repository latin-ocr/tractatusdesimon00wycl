XIV INTRODUCTION.

been obliged to ask for the MS. once more, this time on my own
responsibility; for the late Director of the Imperial Library, Vienna, did not
seem inclined to allow it to be sent there again. This rendered it impossible
for me to do as Ι intended3 and I have been obliged to follow the
spelling of i, the second best MS. But it matters very little3 the copyists,
as is well known, did not follow their originals in that⁷ but spelt as they
chose. The modern spelling of Latin might have been adopted just as
well; but that would have destroyed the mediaeval character of the work.¹

HI. Authen'tici'ty and. Date Of De simonia.

Concerning the authenticity of this work, there is little or nothing
to be said. No one acquainted with Wyclif’s opinions, his methods of
argumentation, and his style, would for an instant hesitate to ascribe
De simonia to him. He himself in his later works (for instance, in De
Apostasia, p. 90) refers to it without naming the author, according to
his custom when quoting tractates of his own. It forms a distinct part
of his great Summa Theologiae, and as such, has an authenticity equal
to any other of those parts. We may besides add that it is named in
all lists of his works, as a part of his Summa3 to which the note in i also
bears witness: “Incipit De Symonia, et est liber X in ordine summe sue.''

For a very different reason, we can say but little about the exact
date of this work. In the astonishing outpour of the last years of our
author’s life, it is very difficult to fix a precisely accurate date for any
of his works, unless he happens to mention some event which was taking
place whilst he wrote, and which is besides sufficiently known to his-
tory. Now there is no such mention in De Simonia. On the other hand,
we are able to get a sufficient degree of approximation to the date.
De Blasplzemia, as stated in the Introduction to that work, seems to
have been written in 1381, or at the beginning of 1382, when the
Peasants⁷ Revolt was quite recent. De Apostasia certainly precedes De
Blasplzemz'a‚· and De Simonia comes just before. We may then with some
probability place the last treatise at the beginning of 1380 or towards
the end of 1379, and immediately after De Eucharistia, which it quotes.
