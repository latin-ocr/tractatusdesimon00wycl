XVIII INTRODUCTION.

St. Thomas indeed, with the whole School, goes farther, and admits
the theory of an ‘accidens sine subjecto’. But this is an attempt at explain-
ing the mystery (not indeed a very successful attempt); it may be wrong.
Wyclif calls it a heresy3 the Church says nothing; but neither does
it make that theory a dogma. Ihave gone into this at some length,
because I have read that Pusey, with remarkable insight into
the matter, gave it as his opinion, that the difference between Anglican
theologians who admit the Real Presence, and Roman Catholics
who use the term Transubstantiation, is probably a mere question of
words. And in fact, Transubstantiation is merely the Real Presence,
defined in such a manner as to exclude all explanations inconsistent
therewith.

2. What struck Wyclif as intolerable in the explanation given by
the SchooL was their theory of the annihilation of the bread; which, as
we have already remarked, is not the exact doctrine of St. Thomas,
though it seems a logical outcome of his system. If I understand him
rightly, the ‘substance' of bread is neither where its appearances are,
nor anywhere else, because, this substance having become Christ's Body‚
it is no longer bread in the other mysterious sense of reality to which
I have already referred; but it is not annihilated. In like manner, when
the elements undergo a chemical change, v. g. when the sacramental
wine becomes vinegar, Christ's Body is there no longer, because the
sensible reality (or appearance) oswine is there no more; but Aquinas
denies that any new substance is created by God to take the place of
Christ’s Body which becomes absent. He asserts that the new nature of
real vinegar proceeds from the change in the appearances, in what we
call sensible reality; — though as, in his doctrine, this reality is a mere
‘accidens sine subjecto’, he frankly admits that it is difficult to see how
they can produce a ‘subjectum³. “Quomodo autem ex eis aliquid gene-
rari possit, difficile est videre, (IIIa Pars, qu. LXXVII, art 5.: Respon-
deo . . .) But the Nominalists of the following century set St. Thomas’
cautious doctrine aside, and by their multiplied and arbitrary annihilations
and re-creations, called forth Wyclis’s indignant protest. The fact is, as
we shall see in our author's philosophical works, that his whole system
falls to the ground if we admit the possibility of annihilation, and as,
St. Thomas himself says, we can hardly escape admitting it as a fact,

with the doctrine of ‘accidens sine subjecto³.
