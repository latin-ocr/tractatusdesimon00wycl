INTRODUCTION. XXI

for instance, attempt to prove that Christ was born ten years before or
after A. D. 1, this would certainly be left to be dealt with by chrono-
logists and historians, because, even if false, even if generally believed, it
would have no effect whatever upon the minds of Catholics. And in
almost every condemnation we find an epithet specifying that effect:
temerarious, dangerous, scandamus, and lastly heretical. Now, Wyclif's
theory of the Eucharist certainly tended (though no doubt nothing was
further from his intention) to destroy the belief in Christ's Real Presence
— a dogma of the Church. Those who, like Gallio, ‘care for none of
these things’, or who are convinced that both Wyclif and the Church
of Rome were in error in affirming that dogma, will of course consider
his condemnation unjustifiable from any point of view.

Perhaps Ι ought here to apologize for having discussed at such
great length a matter so abstruse, so often dealt with elsewhere, and
forming so very small a part of the treatise under consideration. My
only excuse is, that I was anxious to set before the public certain thoughts
which occured to me after I had written the Introductions to De Apostasia
and De Blasphemz'a, and which I shall probably never have an oppor-
tunity to publish anywhere else.

We may now proceed to examine Dc Simonia itself, chapter by
chapter.

Chapter I. Simony is a sin against the Holy Ghost, as apostasy
is a sin against the Father, and blasphemy, against the Son. This being
the unpardonable sin, it behoves the Church to guard against it with
extreme care. It is an inordinate will or desire (volicio) to exchange
spiritual for temporal things. This will, if not inordinate, is not a sin.
We may sell ourselves to God for life eve1·lasting; and God sells grace
to us, if we give ourselves to Him. But, in a general sense, every sin,
being an inordinate act of the will, a preference of temporal pleasure
to eternal happiness, is a selling of the soul to the devil, and is there-
fore simony. In a more restricted signification, it means an unlawful
contract to obtain some spiritual office. Any contract of the sort is called, in
theological language, a gift (munus). If what is promised, is money, it
is munus a mann: if services to be rendered, munus ab obsequi03 if influ-
ence, munus a lingua. Almost all the clergy are infected with this heresy,
and those highest placed are the worst. Christ turned those who sold
doves out of the temple3 the Church is the mystic dove, and its selling
