ΧΠ INTRODUCTION.

necting link between them and lc. The readings of a b c d e fg very
often agree in contradicting Ιι and i, and there can be no doubt that
these seven MSS. were copied from the very same source. There are
many proofs of this; but it will suffice here to select one of the most
striking, on p. 81, l. 24, 25. The words from fructum to ministerio
are absent from a b c e fg, and have been supplied by another hand
in d. This agreement is certainly not accidental, and can be accounted
for only by the supposition of a common source. This original (Z), there-
fore, stands in the same sisterly relation to i as Y to the source of Ῐι.

But α b c d e f g do not all proceed from Z in the same way.
I think that only b, d (before correction) and f were copied directly
from Z; and even for these, the hypothesis of intermediate copies might
be allowed, on account of a nearer relationship between b and f,
and a closer agreement of d with h and i, At all events the resemblance
between c and e on the one hand, and a (before correction) and g on
the other, is strikingly close, and extends even to the spelling. This fol-
lows from the variants in the foot-notes, and would appear with still
greater evidence, were it not for the difficulties mentioned at the outset.
These prevented, not only a careful selection of the variants of c and e
(partly, too, of f), but also a proper correction of the proof-sheets.
The relationship of a with g may also be demonstrated by a proos extrinsic
to the text: the index of catchwords, which (as I have carefully ascer-
tained) belongs to these MSS. alone. A close examination has shown me the
impossibility of α and c being copied from g and e,· or rice versa. We can
only frame a third hypothesis, vi2., that α and g are copies of another MS.
(A) and that c and e proceed again from another (B), So that A and B,
which have not come down to us, stand in the same relation to Z as h,

cI, and f. The transmission of the nine MSS. may, therefore, be set
forth in the following diagram:
