Subsequently, however, the value of cl was modified bya thorough
correction with a manuscript closely related to lz, so that the text be-
comes almost identical with that of the latter MS. The corrections of a,
which are perhaps based on an z· text, are much less important, and
do not alter its features to any great extent. Of course, these sub-
sequent modifications do not change the original relations of the MSS.
to each other.

The best text is supplied by lz. This is seen, not indeed at first sight,
but after attentively comparing it with the others; both its pedigree and
the similarity of the corrections in cl tend to confirm this deeision. It
generally gives the best sense of all of them: in most of the places where it
seriously differs from the others, its readings are usually found preferable.
However, to construet a text, we are obliged to avail ourselves both ofi
and of the Z group. In doubtful cases and in the case ofindifferent variations,
so far asI have noted them,I have kept to the readings of lz. It
may often be wrong, I admit3 but the principle of following in such
cases the MS. which is the best in the main, is the only means we have
of preserving the text from being formed by the editor⁷s own arbitrary
choiee. Ι ought even to have followed the spelling of lz; but circums-
stanees rendered that impossible. When in Vienna, I was indeed able
(by Prof. Ingram’s courtesy) to collate the Dublin MS. with my copy;
but I was not certain that it was the best until long after I had returned
it. ln my eollafion, I had overlooked the spelling, and should have
