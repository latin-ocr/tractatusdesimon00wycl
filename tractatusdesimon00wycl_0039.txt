INTRODUC'l'loN. XXXV

There are three remedies for this abuse. The Pope, though it
cannot be expected of him, might effect a thorough reform; the secular
power might take back the endowments3 or the people (which is most
likely) might withdraw their tithes and offerings. Instead of the Colleges
being destroyed, they would profit thereby; for the patronage of the
livings would be sufficient to maintain them. —- There are also pay-
ments made to laymen for defending the monasteries, whilst the
prelates live in luxury and extravagance. It is said that, if not thus
paid, the laymen would despoil the convents of their income. But
such payments amount to doing evil that good may come, and that
is forbidden by the Church. We may not commit the slightest sin,
even to save the whole world; and even if the religious houses were
dissolved, the only result would be that the monks and their property
would be spread about everywhere in the world, and do more
good. If we want to lead a monastic life, let us ssee to the desert,
and not live in towns, ousting laymen from their proper functions
(pp- 93—98).

Chapter VIII is levelled at the temporal lords and all other classes
of men who are tainted with simony. Wyclif begins by positing as a
principle that any man who consents to simony is responsible for the
same. Rulers may be ignorant of what simony is, and consent in igno-
rance; but it is their business to know. Now consent is implied, either
by contributing actively to any deed, by defending it, by advising it,
by allowing it, or even by remaining passive. And most Friars consent
to simony in the last way. We must not await the decision of the courts
of law to consider any man as 3 simoniac; court judgments may be
purchased, and a judge may also be infected with simony‚ thus becoming
incompetent to judge. It is essential that a judge should have the requi-
site¹qualitiesz power, conscientiousness, knowledge, and goodneSS. If
not, he will only condemn himself whilst he condemns others, as
did Christ's judges. We are obliged to obey those in authority, but
only when they are in the right. We have freewill and reason,
given us by God. The people ought to rise up against pastors whom
they know to be idiots set over thern for the sake oflucre; they would
have Canon law in their favour. As things stand, if an incumbent died
regularly in the course of the first year of possession, the Papal collec-

or would take, not only a part of the benefice, but the whole; and if
