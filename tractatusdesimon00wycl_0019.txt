INTRODUCTION. XV

It certainly comes after September 20, 1378 (the date of the election of
the Antipope Clement VII), for it alludes to the court of Avignon as
being a nest of simony (p. 9). But the fact is that, until all the works
of Wyclif are edited, and their texts carefully studied — a labour which
of course belongs to the future —- it is impossible to do more than
arrive at a conjectural conclusion as to the exact date of most of
Wyclif's works. The editors of Wyclif have to cope with too many and
more pressing difficulties, and cannot go into a close examination of
words and expressions which, with the aid of a perfect knowledge of
the annals of that time, might possibly enable them to give an exact
date; though even this is doubtful. At any rate, it would be the labour
of a lifetime; and future antiquarians will, no doubt, excuse us if we
leave something for them to do, whilst our present editions will immeasur-

ably lighten their labours.

1V. Contents Os De Simonia.

In this short treatise, Wyclif seems less addicted to digression than
is his wont. He generally keeps strictly to his point; and the division
of the treatise is clear enough. Simony is committed by the Pope, the
Bishops, the endowed Orders, and the temporal Lords. After a general
definition of simony, and answers to objections (pp. 1—27) Wyclif attacks
the Pope (pp. 27—7o)‚ the Bishops (pp. 70—84) and the endowed Orders
(pp. 84—98), and warns the temporal Lords (pp. 98 to end). The only
real digressions from the main subject —- and they are very short —
are on pp. 39 and 69, in which Wyclif inveighs against the doctrine,
then generally received, of absolute accidents in the Eucharist. It may
be as well to examine this point apart, before going into a detailed
summary of Wyclif's doctrines as regards simony; the more so, as I
am thereby enabled to supplement some of my remarks on the same
subject in De Apostasz'a.

Christ having, at the Last Supper, said of the sacramental bread
and wine ‘This is My Body, this is My Bl00d‚³ whilst no outward change
of the bread or the wine took place, the question naturally, and from
the very first, arose in every thinking mind: In what sense are those
words true, as true they must certainly be? From an examination of
other passages, especially the well-known words of St. Paul in his
Epistle to the Corinthians, it became a universal doctrine both in the
